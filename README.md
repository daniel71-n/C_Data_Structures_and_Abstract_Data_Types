# C_Data_Structures_and_Abstract_Data_Types
Various data structures and implementations of Abstract Data Types

Note:

None of the implementations are thread-safe. 
The point is to illustrate the DSs and ADTs themselves, rather than thread-safety.
Fundamentally, threads imply the existence of some kind of operating system, while one could of course be using data structures on 'bare metal'.
